                            How many days did I spend <br/>
                            Thinkin' 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?<br/>
                            Lived in the shade you were throwin'<br/>
                            'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone<br/>
                            And I couldn't get away from you<br/>
                            In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah<br/>
                            Your name on my lips, tongue tied<br/>
                            Free rent, livin' in my mind<br/>
                            But then something happened one magical night<br/><br/>
                            
                            
                            I forgot that you existed<br/>
                            And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br/>
                            And it was so nice<br/>
                            So peaceful and quiet<br/><br/>
                           
                            I forgot that you existed<br/>
                            It isn't love, it isn't hate<br/>
                            It's just indifference<br/><br/>

                            I forgot that you<br/>
                            Got out some popcorn<br/>
                            As soon as my rep starting going down, down, down<br/>
                            Laughed on the schoolyard<br/>
                            As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground<br/>
                            And I would've stuck around for ya<br/>
                            Would've fought the whole town, so yeah<br/>
                            Would've been right there front row<br/>
                            Even if nobody came to your show<br/>
                            But you showed who you are, then one magical night<br/><br/>

                            I forgot that you existed<br/>
                            And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br/>
                            And it was so nice<br/>
                            So peaceful and quiet<br/><br/>

                            I forgot that you existed<br/>
                            It isn't love, it isn't hate<br/>
                            It's just indifference<br/><br/>

                            I forgot that you<br/>
                            Sent me a clear message<br/>
                            Taught me some hard lessons<br/>
                            I just forget what they were<br/>
                            It's all just a blur<br/><br/>

                            I forgot that you existed<br/>
                            And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br/>
                            And it was so nice<br/>
                            So peaceful and quiet<br/><br/>

                            I forgot that you existed<br/>
                            I did, I did, I did<br/>
                            It isn't hate, it's just indifference<br/>
                            It isn't love, it isn't hate<br/>
